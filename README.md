# Your Local Weather

This project was an excecise to learn how to use external or third-party API along with the assocaited fetch commands. Then use the information obtained from those APIs and build a site with it. 

## What we are doing

This site is for local (or not local) weather. The site will ask the user for a city name and return the weather for the desired location. A list of cities that were previously searched will display as buttons below the search area to be accessed again quickly.

Each time a city is selected the site will generate a button to be added to the previously searched cities. If a prior cities button is selected it will load the weather for that city.
